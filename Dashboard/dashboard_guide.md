# How to run Insurance Claims Interactive Dashboard
This document provides instructions on how to run and view the interactive dashboard created for the Insurance Claims Data Analysis project. 
Before running the dashboard, please ensure you have the following library installed:
* **Required Libraries:** If you haven't installed them yet, open your command prompt or terminal and run:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy plotly dash dash-bootstrap-components openpyxl
    ```
## Running the Dashboard

There are two primary ways to run the dashboard:

### Option 1: Using a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file)

* **How:** If a Jupyter Notebook version of the dashboard code is provided (`.ipynb` file), you can open it using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab and run all the cells.
* **Limitation:** Running a Dash application directly within a standard Jupyter Notebook output cell might **not display the dashboard at its full size** or render the layout perfectly as intended. It's suitable for quick checks but not the ideal viewing experience.

### Option 2: Using the Python Script via Command Prompt/Terminal (Recommended)

This method runs the dashboard as a standalone web application, ensuring correct display and full functionality.

1.  **Update Data Path in Script:**
    * **ðŸ”´ IMPORTANT:** Open the dashboard Python script (likely named `dashboard_app.py` or `dashboard.py` - please verify the exact filename in the repository) using a text editor or IDE.
    * Locate the line defining the `file_path` variable near the beginning of the script (within the Data Loading section).
    * **Modify this path** to point **exactly** to where you saved the `Cleaned_Insurance_Claims_Data.xlsx` file on your computer.
        ```python
        # Example inside the dashboard script:
        # Modify this line with your actual path
        file_path = r"C:\Users\YourUser\Downloads\Dataset\Cleaned Data\Cleaned_Insurance_Claims_Data.xlsx"
        ```

2.  **Open Command Prompt (CMD) or Terminal:**
    * Launch your system's terminal application (CMD or PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux).

3.  **Navigate to the Dashboard Directory:**
    * Use the `cd` (change directory) command to move into the folder containing the dashboard script (`dashboard_app.py` or `dashboard.py`).
    * Example (replace with the actual path on your machine):
        ```bash
        cd D:\Study\3. CODE\1. Python_code_file\Big_Data\group_assignment\Dashboard
        ```
        *(Adjust the drive letter and folder names as needed)*

4.  **Run the Python Script:**
    * Execute the dashboard script by typing the following command and pressing Enter:
        ```bash
        python dashboard_app.py
        ```
        *(Replace `dashboard_app.py` with the correct script name if it's different, e.g., `python dashboard.py`)*

5.  **Access the Dashboard URL:**
    * After the script runs successfully, it will start a local web server. Look for output in the terminal similar to this:
        ```
        Dash is running on [http://127.0.0.1:8051/](http://127.0.0.1:8051/)
        ```
        *(The address is typically `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`, and the port number might be `8051` or another number specified in the code).*
    * Copy this full URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8051/`).

6.  **View in Browser:**
    * Open your preferred web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.).
    * Paste the copied URL into the browser's address bar and press Enter.

7.  **Interact:**
    * The interactive dashboard should now load in your browser. Explore the different tabs (Customer, Products, Broker) and use the dropdown filters within each tab to dynamically update the charts.

8.  **Stop the Server:**
    * When you are finished, go back to the Command Prompt/Terminal window where the script is running.
    * Press `Ctrl + C` to shut down the local web server.

This method (Option 2) is recommended for the best user experience with the interactive features and layout of the Dash application. Remember to **always update the data file path** first!
